# HTML-Vite Starter Template

This is a basic starter template for HTML projects using Vite as the build tool. It provides a simple directory structure with an `index.html` file, a `style.css` file, and a `main.js` file.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository or download the template files.
2. Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
4. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:

   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

5. Once the installation is complete, start the development server by running:

   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will launch a local development server and open the application in your default browser.

## Directory Structure

The directory structure for this template is as follows:

```
├── src
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── main.js
│   └── style.css
├── public
│   ├── assets
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── vite.config.js
└── README.md

```

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for your project.
- `src`: This directory contains the JavaScript and CSS files.
  - `main.js`: The main JavaScript file where you can write your application logic.
  - `style.css`: The CSS file for styling your HTML elements.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies which files and directories to ignore in version control.
- `package.json` and `package-lock.json`: Files containing project metadata and dependencies.
- `README.md`: This file, providing instructions and information about the template.

## Development Workflow

When you run `npm run dev`, Vite will start a local development server and automatically reload your application whenever you make changes to the source files. You can modify the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files, and the changes will be reflected in real-time in your browser.

To start the project for development, run the following command:

```shell
npm run dev
```

To build the project for production, run the following command:

```shell
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized and minified files in the `dist` directory, ready to be deployed to a web server.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the template to fit your project's needs. You can add additional HTML files, create subdirectories, and install additional dependencies as required.
